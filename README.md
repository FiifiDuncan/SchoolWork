Explanation of the processArray function:
The processArray function takes an array of numbers as input.
It uses the map method to iterate over each element of the array.
For each element, it checks if the number is even or odd using the modulus operator.
If the number is even, it squares the number by multiplying it by itself.
If the number is odd, it triples the number by multiplying it by 3.
The function returns a new array with the modified values based on whether the input number was even or odd.


Explanation of the formatArrayStrings function:
The formatArrayStrings function takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function.
It uses the map method to iterate over each element of the strings array.
For each string, it checks the corresponding number from the numbers array to determine whether to capitalize the string if the number is even or convert it to lowercase if the number is odd.
The function returns a new array of modified strings based on the numbers processed by the processArray function.


Explanation of the createUserProfiles function:
The createUserProfiles function takes an array of names and an array of modifiedNames as input.
It uses the map method to iterate over each element of the names array.
For each name, it creates an object with originalName, modifiedName, and auto-incremented id.
The id is auto-incremented starting from 1 and incremented for each object.
The function returns an array of user profile objects with the specified fields.
